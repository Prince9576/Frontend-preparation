Q) Design an accordian, which when clicked it expands while closing every other Items ( Asked in Amazon ).

Approach =>
1) Get All the Accordians
2) Loop through each and attach the corresponding event listeners 
3) Get the next sibling
4) Toggle the show class
5) Close all the other items if they were expanded. (except the one which was just clicked)
